# Storytelling üîñ

> ‚ÄúA story is not like a road to follow ‚Ä¶ it's more like a house. You go inside and stay there for a while, wandering back and forth and settling where you like and discovering how the room and corridors relate to each other, how the world outside is altered by being viewed from these windows. And you, the visitor, the reader, are altered as well by being in this enclosed space, whether it is ample and easy or full of crooked turns, or sparsely or opulently furnished. You can go back again and again, and the house, the story, always contains more than you saw the last time. It also has a sturdy sense of itself of being built out of its own necessity, not just to shelter or beguile you.‚Äù
‚Äï Alice Munro, Selected Stories

This repository aggregates stories about (and how the nature of storytelling relates to) computers.  

May we continue to share our stories with each other in order to better understand what we're doing.

| [The Wet Codebase]() | "I think one way to try to break this loop is just when we teach something to the next generation, we shouldn't just be two-dimensional and say here's best practices and anti-patterns. But we should try to explain what is it that you're actually trading away. What are the benefits and what are the costs of this idea."  In this talk, Dan Abramov tells the story of the evolution of an abstraction over time. | Dan Abramov | 2019 | [Deconstruct](https://www.deconstructconf.com/)
